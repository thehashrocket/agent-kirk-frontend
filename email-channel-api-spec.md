## Implementation Notes

### Data Type Requirements
- **Percentages**: Open rates and CTR should be returned as decimal numbers (e.g., 39.48, not 0.3948)
- **Numbers**: All numeric fields should be integers or floats, not strings
- **Strings**: Text fields should be properly escaped strings
- **Arrays**: Both `campaignActivity` and `websiteActivity` must be arrays, even if empty

### Date Format Requirements
- **dateRange fields**: Must use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **delivered field**: Can use human-readable format (e.g., "Apr 17, 2025")
- **avgSessionDuration**: Must use HH:MM:SS format (e.g., "00:01:23")

### Response Requirements
- All fields marked as "Required" must be present in the response
- Empty arrays should be returned as `[]`, not `null`
- Numeric fields should never be `null` - use `0` for missing values
- String fields should never be `null` - use empty string `""` for missing values

### Performance Considerations
- The endpoint should respond within 2 seconds
- Consider pagination for large datasets (campaignActivity array)
- Implement proper caching strategies for frequently requested data

### Authentication
- The endpoint should respect the existing authentication system
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for unauthorized requests

## Frontend Usage
The frontend will:
- Call this endpoint on component mount
- Refresh data every 60 seconds
- Display loading states while fetching
- Handle error states gracefully
- Format the data for display in tables and metric cards

## Testing
Please ensure the endpoint:
- Returns data in the exact format specified
- Handles empty datasets gracefully
- Returns appropriate error responses
- Maintains consistent data types
- Validates all required fields are present
